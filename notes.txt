this is how a form is made

you put the things in the form tag to see the magic

you use input tags and use a submit button at last for sending the form inputted data 

if you dont specify the method, it will take it as 'get' and put the data in the url as query string

if you dont specify the action(i.e which route to take) it will take '/'
